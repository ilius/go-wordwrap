// Package wordwrap is the main package.
package wordwrap

// WordWrap wraps a string, where each "line" of the wrapped string is an item
// of a slice of strings. A limit of zero or less is treated as an infinite
// limit.
//
// If a word is longer than the limit would be allowed even after breaking on
// word separators, then the word itself will be wrapped.
//
// Whitespace such as spaces and tabs are considered word separators that can
// excluded from the output. Hyphens are also considered word separators, but
// will be included at the end of a line.
